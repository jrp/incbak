This is a project writen to handle incremental backups.

It uses rSync and linux hard links to maintain a full set of directories on a local machine of a selected parts of a remote 
machine.

This project is very much paratially complete -- basic functionality can be considered at beta standard, but is by no means 
deployable without a great deal of tinkering.

The plan is to turn it into an hourly incemental backup system with an exponential backoff system on backup dleetions, so as 
to reduce the clutter.
